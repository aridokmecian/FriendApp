# FriendsToGo
### BostonHacks 2019 project by Ari, Christian, Thalia, and Clifton

FriendsToGo is a web application that takes the location of two people and generates an activity itinerary based on a selected theme of interest. We built it using Node.js, Express.js, and the Google Maps Geocoding API.
